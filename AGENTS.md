# Agent Guidelines

- Indentation: Use tabs for indentation across the repository. Do not convert leading tabs to spaces. This applies to Go, C/C headers, scripts, and code blocks in docs.
- Formatting: For Go code, rely on `gofmt` conventions; keep existing tab indentation intact.
- Scope of edits: Keep changes minimal and focused; do not reflow or reindent unrelated lines.
- Commits: Do not add auto-generated footers or signatures.

These conventions help reduce churn in diffs and remain consistent with the projectâ€™s existing style.
