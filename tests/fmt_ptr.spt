# The purpose of this test is to check if variables are promoted to memory from register
# basic operations and expressions run without a hitch (the compiler dereferences the pointers and then evaluates)
# for this we currently use the printf function with %n specifier. The %n specifier expects a pointer as the variable.

x = 10
"four-x%n. Wrote four characters to x"
"x is now -x and a pointer on the stack automatically dereferenced for use"

y = 0
"write char-y%n. y should now be 10 and allocated on the stack"
z = x * y
"y is -y%d. z = x * y and z is -z%d"
x + y, x - y
"Check the pointer op with vars x, y, z. The result is -x%p -y%p -z%p"
