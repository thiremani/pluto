# Test function calls in print with range iteration

# Simple function call
Square(3)

# Function with range - iterates and calls per value
m = 0:3
m + 1, Square(m)

# Inline range in function call
Square(1:4)

# Named range in function call
i = 0:4
Square(i)

# Named range both direct and in function call
i, Square(i)

# Two bare ranges - should print as representations
j = 1:3
i, j

# One bare range, one expression - should iterate
i, j + 1

# Different ranges - nested iteration (4 x 2 = 8 lines)
i, Square(j + 1)

# Same range used bare and in expression - single loop
j, Square(j + 1)

# Regression test: mixed expression with function not called with scalars before
# SumSquares(k, k) creates Range variant, but k+1 forces iteration needing scalar variant
k = 0:2
k + 1, SumSquares(k, k)
