a = 16
b = 4

# Subtraction with spaces on both sides
[a - b]

# Two elements: a and -b (no space after minus)
[a -b]

# Subtraction without spaces
[a-b]

# Two elements with multiple spaces before minus
[a  -b]

# Multiple negative elements
[a -b -b]

# Mix of positive and negative
[a b -b]

# Subtraction result followed by literal
[a-b 5]

# Subtraction with spaces followed by literal
[a - b 5]

# Two elements (a, -b) followed by literal
[a -b 3]

# Subtraction with space after minus but not before
[a- b 4]

# Prefix-only operator (sqrt) - spacing shouldn't matter
[a √b]
[a √ b]

# Complex expressions with both operators
[a + √b a -√b]
[a + √ b a -√ b]

# Minus followed by sqrt with spaces - should be subtraction
[a - √ b]
[a - √b]
